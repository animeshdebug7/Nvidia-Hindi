## Problem Description
The input dataset will consist of images containing Hindi characters. The challenge is to identify the presence of a character in images using Convolutional Neural Networks.

The dataset will contain the following:

* Train Dataset: Consists of sample reference sets which can be used by participants to train the Convolution Neural Network. The participants are recommended to use their own training dataset if required. 
* Test Dataset: The test dataset will contain the images to be classified and results to be submitted in the form of a JSON file. More details on the JSON format and a sample provided as part of the dataset.
Submissions are evaluated on Accuracy Score between the predicted and the actual labels on the test dataset.
